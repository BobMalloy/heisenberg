Heisenberg - Zeek Starter Theme
===

This is the Zeek Starter theme, based on Underscores and Foundation 5.5.1.

## Dependencies
###Gulp
The theme dependencies are listed in our `package.json` file. If you run `npm install`, all of the plugin dependencies will be install onto `node_modules`.

### Bower
We use bower as our front end package manager. To get started, run `bower install` and all of the packages will be brought into the `.assets/components` directory. We've overriden the default `bower_components` directory in `.bowerrc`; all bower files are sent to `./assets/components`.
